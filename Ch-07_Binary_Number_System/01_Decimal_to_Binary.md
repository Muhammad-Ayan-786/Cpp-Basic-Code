## Example 1: Converting 42‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ to Binary

| √∑2 | Quotient | Remainder |
|----|-----------|------------|
| 42 | 21 | 0 |
| 21 | 10 | 1 |
| 10 | 5  | 0 |
| 5  | 2  | 1 |
| 2  | 1  | 0 |
| 1  | 0  | 1 |

**Binary:** Write the remainders from bottom to top ‚Üí  
**(42)‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ = (101010)‚ÇÇ**

## Example 2: Converting 50‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ to Binary

| √∑2 | Quotient | Remainder |
|----|-----------|------------|
| 50 | 25 | 0 |
| 25 | 12 | 1 |
| 12 | 6  | 0 |
| 6  | 3  | 0 |
| 3  | 1  | 1 |
| 1  | 0  | 1 |

**Binary:** Write from bottom to top ‚Üí  
**(50)‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ = (110010)‚ÇÇ**

üìò **Method Summary:**  
1. Divide the decimal number by 2.  
2. Write down the remainder.  
3. Repeat with the quotient until it becomes 0.  
4. The binary number is the remainders **read from bottom to top**.
